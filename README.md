# Airbnb-in-NYC---SparkR-Analysis

This project is part of my coursework for module Big data managment and data visualisation at Coventry university.

The accommodation options offered by Airbnb in NYC in 2019 are analysed using Spark. We are using R frontend for Spark - SparkR. For data manipulation the R package sparklyr is used which brings the functionality of dplyr package to Spark. To generate plots we are using ggplot2. Finally, to train regression models to predict the price of an accommodation we use Rsparkling. This is an R frontend to Sparkling water, implementation of H2O for Spark.

The dataset is accessible at Kaggle:
